# GrindCutter2
Minecraft Datapack (Java edition 1.16 - 1.17 Snapshot)

Newly-placed stonecutters will "mine" blocks above them. This unlocks new Redstone farming possibilities like an explosion-free cobblestone machine, wood-mining machine, basalt machine, and more!

Q: Why a new version? 
A: The original GrindCutter had no delay before breaking blocks. This version is more balanced, but some players may prefer the original.


How it works:
Stonecutters mine blocks with a 1 second delay!
They can't break bedrock or obsidian.
Only new stonecutters can mine blocks -- old ones work normally
To prevent duping, stonecutters are removed in certain circumstances
when pushed by a piston, the stonecutter loses its mining ability
